    "Deep neural networks have produced large accuracy gains in applications such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. Rapid advancements in this area have been supported by excellent libraries for developing neural networks. These libraries allow users to express neural networks in terms of a computation graph, i.e., a sequence of mathematical operations, that maps vector inputs to outputs. Given this graph, these libraries support learning network parameters from data and furthermore can optimize computation, for example, by using GPUs. The ease of developing neural networks with these libraries is a significant factor in the proliferation of these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, structured prediction problems cannot be easily expressed in neural network libraries. These problems require making a set of interrelated predictions and occur frequently in natural language processing. For example, part-of-speech tagging requires assigning a part-of-speech tag to each word in a sentence, where tags for nearby words may depend on each other. Another example is dependency parsing, which requires predicting a directed tree spanning the words of a sentence. These problems can be posed as predicting a sequence of actions, such as shifts and reduces for parsing. Neural networks can be applied to these problems using locally-normalized models, which produce a probability distribution over each action given all prior actions. However, this approach is known to be suboptimal as it suffers from the *label bias* problem, which is that the scores of future actions cannot affect the scores of previous actions. *Globally-normalized models*, such as conditional random fields, solve this problem by defining a joint distribution over all sequences of actions. These models express a larger class of distributions and provide better predictions than locally-normalized models. Unfortunately, these models cannot be easily expressed or trained using existing neural network libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to design a neural network library that supports structured prediction with globally-normalized models. Our observation is that *nondeterministic computation* is a natural formalism for expressing the decision space of a structured prediction problem. For example, we can express a parser as a function that nondeterministically selects a shift or reduce action, applies it to its current state, then recurses to parse the remainder of the sentence. Our library has a nondeterministic choice operator similar to McCarthy's `amb` for this purpose. We combine nondeterministic choice with a computation graph, which, as demonstrated by neural network libraries, is a powerful way for users to express models. Importantly, *the computation graph interacts with nondeterministic computation*: the scores produced by the neural network determine the probabilities of nondeterministic choices, and the nondeterministic choices determine the network's architecture. The combination of these operations results in a powerful formalism for structured prediction where users specify the decision space using nondeterminism and the prediction models using computation graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement our library as a Scala monad to leverage Scala's powerful type system, library support, and streamlined syntax for monadic operations. A instance `Pp[X]` of the monad represents a function from neural network parameters to a probability distribution over values of type `X`. The monad supports inference operations that take neural network parameters and return (an approximation of) this distribution. Running inference also generates a neural network and performs a forward pass in this network to compute its outputs, which may influence the probability distribution. The library also supports a variety of optimization algorithms for training parameters from data. These training algorithms use the approximate inference algorithms and also run backpropagation in the generated networks."
